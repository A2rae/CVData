*The Executioner of the Citrus Systema, and the muscle of Unnamed & Co., and the only person that keeps the entire squad afloat atop legal responsibilities and bills. Serious but extremely emotional to a fault (still, quite cute!) deep down, yet is a battle machine on the battlefield and a fast, near-unrivalled killer from her roots as a violent, corrupt god, though she has changed her ways. Also a frequent universe hopper.*
