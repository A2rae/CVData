Gender: Male (Transmasc)

Race: Human (?) / God (T11)

Age: 34  (Actual Age: 370+)

### Appearance

Height: 185cm-ish

Weight: Idk tbh

Hair: Wavy-messy brown-reddish hair with dyed blonde tips. Little longer than average.

Skin: Asian tanned colored, like a darker shade of yellowish orange.

Distinguishing marks: The seemingly-tattoolike dark red patterns running down his left-neck to the nape of his spine, doesn’t seem like any normal marking. Tristan covers it up with bandages most of the time.

Eyes: Red colored with an edge of orange. Note that they emit a slight glow in darker lighting conditions.

Clothing: He used to be sloppy with clothing and he still is now. Usually just wears a shirt with red tie and dark blue pants, sometimes with a hoodie over the top.

### Personality

Temperament: An ISTP. He’s rather laidback and sort of an introverted extrovert. Rather impulsive at times but is fully capable of solving problems. Very much irresponsible, but cares greatly for things he likes and will go to the ends of the world if it means it benefits his favorite people (and doesn’t give an ass about people he doesn’t know). Sassy ass, but can get serious in a blink of an eye.

Moral/ethical beliefs: Doesn't believe in karma, and is largely a chaotic neutral, as he abides by laws that only benefit the population and virtually disregards every single law that concerns giving power/benefits to law enforcement or the government. Doesn't give a rat's ass about laws in general tbh, and only truly abides with basic human respect.

Religious beliefs: Atheist in the sense no true god exists and is only a system Cycles devised herself.

Hobbies: Bartending, Art (in specific, design and writing), figuring out ways to entertain the masses, the violin, gaming.

Habits: Crossing feet when idle, pen spinning, exaggerated motions (when stressed).

Quirks/eccentricities: Looks towards the sky whenever something odd happens (he's looking at me!), fills cups around 2cm away from the rim no matter what.

Likes: Good food, cold environments, entertaining kids, birds, teasing Simon, generally being around tolerable people, (refer to hobbies) , Euterpe <3, rushing into dangerous situations, flying, afternoon naps, gaming (in particular RPGs), exploring, writing

Dislikes: Getting controlled, naggy people, the government, paying taxes, being idle for too long, not being prepared, extremely heavy-tasting food

Fears: Laverne, burdening others, bugs, of loss

Strengths: Planning on the go, close combat, sense of direction, negotiation, pain tolerance

Weaknesses: Struggles to follow plans, being too paranoid, willing to risk everything, and by that, he means EVERYTHING, being irresponsible in anything except work related things, sniping, going headfirst into danger just because he can (and not because he's unaware).

Short term goals: Not dying, living in peace and away from any sort of conflict, keeping income stable. Largely he hasn't thought of anything grandiose due to believing anything is hopeless atp.

Long term goals: Distancing himself from Laverne, finding his family, still not dying.

Hopes and desires: On the surface, he denies hoping for anything due to it being nigh impossible to escape Laverne, but secretly he just hopes he can have someone to truly lean on, even if it's too much to ask for.

Occupation: Bartender, part-time mercenary, Leader of the Central AU On-field Squad. (T11: Administrator of the Citrusverse)

Skills: Extreme luck in scenarios that involve chance or in gambling, (limited) energy & reality  manipulation, polearm combat, critical thinking, ability to read code, violin playing, limited self-regeneration, (a limited amount of) magic tricks, scriptwriting

(T11: Full reality manipulation)

Secrets:
- He really, really likes Euterpe, he just doesn't want him to get hurt due to the possibility Laverne might find out.
- He can't stand Simon because he looks awfully similar to Kyo and Tea.
- He feels really guilty for leaving Tai and the "kids" behind.
- He has smoked before, but only in T5-7.
- His white-red flower is his soul, and it's awfully fragile.
- The dark-red lined tattoo stretching from his neck to the nape of his spine is actually a result of being a Countryhuman (it happens when they are in their civilian appearance).
- His regeneration relies on consuming lifeforce of dead characters, even so, his regeneration is quite slow, yet he makes up for this by being agile.
- His power relies on the Citrusverse.
- He has many connections to other people outside of the Citrusverse.
- He canonically dislikes therapists.
- His vision is horrible (nearsightedness), but he doesn’t wear his glasses unless he’s working on paperwork because it’s a hassle to have to wipe them every 50 seconds due to gunpowder and blood.
- Adding onto the above, he guesses his target’s location by his blurry vision and hearing, but if that doesn’t work he just has no choice but to bust out his power to feel around for any presences.
- He secretly steals Euterpe’s shotgun sometimes because it’s one of the only shotguns that can satisfy his demanding reloading speed and rough handling mid-battle.
- T11: Despite being the Administrator of the Citrusverse, he is still limited by the limits of the human body, so he has a whole administrative body consisting of Simon, Rizza, Paperman and Euterpe, with Mnemosyne as its advisor.

### Gear

Always has:

- His flower
- His tophat (though not visible at times, also, it's his pocketspace)
- His dual guns (always somewhere easy to access)
-Kyo's cotton-string-woven bracelet (often times it's hidden under his sleeve, worn on the left wrist)

Sometimes has:
- Yellow scarf
- (Ever so slightly cracked) Safety goggles
- A hoodie jacket
- Harness + sleeve garters (mostly to minimize risk when moving fast)
- Glasses 

### Other Notes

Notable Relationships
- Laverne: 

Other preferences & notes
- His love language is definitely words of affirmation, he is a skrunkly <3
- He cannot handle a sniper, but he’s well versed with the majority of handguns and likes using assault rifles, though he can handle shotguns. He doesn’t know how to use machine guns or rocket launchers.
- He uses a glaive, but he’s okay with other types of polearms. Can’t use a bow.
- He absolutely stinks of floral scent, it doesn’t seem to smell like any type of flower, but it’s definitely a flower scent.
- His hat’s pocket dimension is an absolute mess of actually useful things.
- He is very rich due to Laverne making his bank balance carry on through cycles, but he consistently forgets he’s rich and saves and cuts down on a lot of spending, which results in him getting richer.
- He pays for all the ammo fees for the entire squad.
- Canonically bisexual
- He has an abnormally high body temperature (due to being a Countryhuman in a subtropical climate), so when he has a fever, his temperature can climb to a whopping 50 degrees.
- His favorite food is instant noodles with one sunny-side up egg on top.
- An avid fan of milk tea. He’s such a big fan of it the entire squad knows a thing or two on how to make it themselves.
- He doesn’t use modern tech weapons in the Core Cities, and prefers to use models that are popular in the 21st century, though he does prefer using the EMP bomb drones Euterpe uses.
- He uses molotov cocktails as his secondary method of attack, which confuses the shit out of people who think it’s an “Old Age” thing.
- He has a driver’s license for the company van and personal motorcycle, yet he prefers to hitch rides illegally on buses to cut down on gas spending.
- He mainly owns two types of shoes, sneakers, and dress shoes. He does have one pair of boots, but it’s old as shit.
- He likes Tetris, and absolutely despises claw machines.
- He is the only one who can read Laverne’s messy handwriting. Simon can, but it’s majorly guesswork.
