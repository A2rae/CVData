*Adoptive child of Euterpe and Tristan. Bory may be just a plushie granted with life, but she is no less as positive, innocent and emotional as a human child. Can somehow teleport between universes, but that's okay! Bory likes travelling :D. Bory loves her family and could never dream of losing them.*
