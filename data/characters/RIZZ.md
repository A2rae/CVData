The AI helper that lives in the server boxes in Euterpeâ€™s work office. Sassy and capable of making jokes, yet prefers to be more monotonous and robotic when working, which can be a shocker for some. But she really only cares for the well-being of the Citrusverse and her administrator, and largely regards others as functionally neglectable, though she enjoys chatting up Simon from time to time, or playing Sudoku on the public Core City Sudoku Leaderboards.*
