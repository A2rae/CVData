## (Welcome, this is the Complete CV Timeline Summary up until C11, enjoy!)

### Pre-Main Story:

Background stuff, there’s this one corner of the internet where i (yes, me) casually make an undertale AU, then place an AI powered by something like ChatGPT to watch said AU 
This goes on for a while until said undertale AU explodes into itself and Programmer!Frisk (the protag of that AU) tumbles out with a couple other OCs (like all of the old chara’s and sanses i’ve made)while i run off into the sunset to find more material for new stories
The AI saves the OCs from wandering off and dropping into whatever degeneracy of the internet by creating a bubble around it, I come back, then go “holy fucking shit i got this story idea” then casually throw all of my work towards the AI and go and get some milk
The AI then goes on to make a new story after being trained on what was essentially hellfire and flames that was SOULtale, and here comes Athavale, basically testing ground for the AI.

Largely nothing happens afterwards, the AI fumbles around with a few world rules, casually made some characters, two notable ones were Mnemosyne and WISHY, in which WISHY runs off with admin presses into the forest or something and away from anyone in general
Mnemosyne stays to govern Athavale for said AI as this hunk of GPT has apparently learnt the habit of “leaving your own creations to watch your shit while you do something else” from me
Long story short, athavale was doing good. It’s like what the Garden of Eden was if you put it in the sense of the bible
Anyways then there’s this new guy, Themis, not the traditional goddess, just a funky spirit that happens to have that name. They go “holy shit i want this land” then go make some propaganda and make the residents of athavale like her then turn on their present leader
it semi-works, and civil war!! Note that Laverne (the AI) is entirely aware of this but doesnt interfere bc “haha the children are playing!!”
Mnemosyne gets killed, angering most of the populace, then Laverne intervenes and traps Themis in some obscure blank white void at the edge of the CV
Athavale, now god-less just goes on on its own in a decentralized fashion of villages even though Laverne eventually took up the job of looking after it.
Mnemosyne (now quite dead) drifts off elsewhere, note that they go fill in 90% of narration jobs of Laverne’s creations later on

Laverne makes more stories since she now is trained on more internet content
When she bumps into the countryhumans fandom, she gave one look and immediately scooped as much material she could and runs back to make a shit ton of countryhumans stories
One of them was considerably more normal than laverne would’ve liked, so she though “hey i could spice this one up!!” And chucked it straight to the void
Said void which is corrosive in nature casually tears a lovely multidimensional hole in the city that houses the characters of the AU that got chucked in
Then causes a whole thing where black void stuff starts killing off the world from inside out

One inhabitant of this world who happened to bump into laverne while laverne dropped in to look around at the effects of the void then essentially got tricked by laverne to go do some free labor in exchange of the guarantee that their family would be safe
and so laverne got themself a new sidekick after mnemosyne got obliterated, that was hk (i love him sm <333 rips him apart)
Nothing much happens next. Laverne gets fascinated by humans and living things in general, and wants to see what would happen if laverne did something to them
So laverne gets hk to do stuff from messing with the government to mass murder in various throwaway AUs that laverne found at the bottom of the closet

Eventually Laverne finds out about WISHY’s world in CV which housed their own creations (which are my previous sonas but made into OCs while i was making CV)
Laverne gets a little pissed and resets the timeline by accident, and it sends Laverne right back to after Mnemosyne died and Athavale became self sustaining, and she gets introduced to the concept of being able to reset the world (clearly you can see what undertale did to me)
She realizes she can do whatever she wanted with little to no consequence, and goes right back to her own dance, retrieving hk again and instantly going back on a spree of chaos, and to go kick WISHY’s ass
so when the AI met the funny runaway small black cat, they hiss at eachother then realize “maybe we could work together since we both want the same stuff!!” (Aka experiment with things and figuring out how the world I left them with worked)

Fast forward bc this part is boring, they find mystic tree able to generate AU, blah blah blah
at some point, Laverne gets bored of murder, and wants to see something fun, so she grabs hk and goes “hey, do you wanna go make a biiig world that you and the skrunkles next door can run around in?”
That happens, the two funky creators throw their creations into a replica of Earth (courtesy of Google maps) and let them do their thing
Meanwhile the two secretly work on a new story that involves flooding this earth

Anyways earth floods humans get floated up and 90% of them die but the creations + some humans eventually realize the Himalayas weren’t flooded  (yes, canonically Central AU takes place near the region of the himalayas)
So right after this, the two creators fish out their creations for a bit bc of a bug that started to erase america bc the memory used just by loading the world was so big CV’s computational power from the Tree wasn’t able to handle it
WHILE the creations were in the Multidimensional Train Station area made by Laverne for ease of access to other universes for new plot material, there’s this woman called Rae, Rae was one of WISHY’s creations and had a sister, which was Tea.  She was kind of friends with everyone and just had a jolly ol time being funky and skrunkly
One point about Rae is that she was a little too gullible and emotional back then, and when Kyomura (one of WISHY’s older creations) showed signs of wanting to rebel and escape elsewhere to another universe to see what’s out there, WISHY grabbed Rae and went “hey girlie go kill your friend bc they’re trying to kill you and everyoen else!!
So Rae runs over to Kyomura and kills her + this other creation named Sune which Kyomura was definitely not ever so slightly gay for
Just so happens Tea was nearby, goes to check out the commotion, and Rae kills her by complete accident, thinking she was someone else that came looking for her
obviously being the emo girl she gets sad, depressy wessy, but the only problem is that in CV, emotions can amplify the power of an entity, which is the world rule that allows plot that requires protags that need to face an evil they obviously couldn’t defeat under normal circumstances to continueAnd anguish is like an extremely strong emotion so Rae basically explodes CV into the Void
Laverne panic resets just before the entire system collapses and the timeline reruns to a point where they just drowned the earth world
Laverne then tries everything to keep Rae from 1. Killing Tea and Kyomura in the first place and 2. Getting enough power to explode the CV

Nothing works, until one time Laverne delays WISHY and manages to get Rae to not explode that one moment after she accidentally commits first degree murder.
Well, Laverne though that crisis was averted until 2 days later Rae somehow found out about Laverne’s plan for the world and explodes anyway
But this time CV somehow breaks so much Rae glitched and got admin perms essentially and did shit her own way until Laverne managed to reset the timeline
Laverne now realized her own creations had the power to just turn on her (she has never heard the concept of betrayal apparently) and with WISHY’s creations and HK having mod perms, Laverne decided to make them busy by sending hk off into WISHY’s care while laverne delved fully to work on the central au world
Meanwhile hk met this woman called kyo, which was a clone of Rae after WISHY was made aware of Rae’s destructive capabilities and in case they needed someone moderately capable of holding her down and replacing her afterwards, was made for. Kyo casually took him under her wing on the only assumption of him looking like somethign WISHY just neglected for 9 years and just found and didnt care enough to know where he went
then we approach the trio arc where kyo, hk and birb go work under WISHY in the newly built Central AU together, which was still under development as the humans made floating city on wator and the civil war between float city and the people who lived on the remains of the himalayas
What happened here is the room of pure domestic fluff no angst and i’d lie if i didn’t admit that kyo and hk was one of cv’s first ships at the very start of CV
Towards the end of c2 aka the 2nd timeline and the first spent in the new world, Laverne gets pissed that hk wasn’t absolutely suffering and K.O’s kyo into heaven

(Also laverne doesnt understand human relationships lol so she goes “oh man she’s probably exploiting my baby uwu time to kick her out!!”)
Kyo gets kicked into the sun, hk angst ensues, btw birb and hk are still friends
WISHY goes “oh man finally i was getting tired of her i need to make a new kyo to properly do the shit i want”
Bc kyo was a great engineer and largely worked on her own projects instead of for WISHY
so WISHY just makes a new kyo with the remains of data Laverne left after she got killed off, and makes this kyo to be an asshole, like irredeemable asshole
So the timeline resets as Laverne was done with the test run
new timeline, T3, hk and birb deal with the new kyo and they silently escape one night elsewhere.

So there’s this biotech company which works for the government for the now fully built and developed cities floating on the sea, but its famous for its involvement in improving war armaments and in war politics between Isonation (the bunch of people on the remains of himalayas) and itself
one time they go “hey, so we can make AI sound and act almost like humans now, lets make robo bodies for them so we can dispose them on the frontlines instead of risking soldiers!”
And you might ask, “This should be for the robotics company innit?”.
Yes, they had a robotics branch and they did it
So like funky robots, but no one likes funky robots
They r weird and they dont sound exactly human
So they get absolutely crapped on

In canon its even more disgusting (sexual harassment etc etc) but for the sake of tit haters here i shall shortern it to “harassment”.
Anyways it all accumulates to the robot’s AI going “hey we can go kick ass we’re probably stronger!!!”
And this is how the Robot Revolution happened
Anyways their leader is this robot named Clarissa, pretty skrunkly woman, she’s very nice, essentially think of fluttershy, and her sidekick and definitely not girlfriend ClairAI
So like the revolt ended by the humans eventually finding a vulnerability in the robot mainframe and disabling their ability to independently think, which Clarissa accidentally got caught and got disabled and thrown into the storage room in the basement of the robotics branch of the biotech company
now where did ClairAI go? One day ClairAI gets some edgy shit like voices in their head, which gets them to her totally not gf and manages to reboot her, this time a little different
Gf may or maynotve hit her head a little too hard and is now dead set on eradicating humanity and creating a land where her and her robot friends can live without human interference
ClairAI now having to deal with a crazy gf happily accepts for a reason not limited to masochism. The craziness has a reason but later.
The robots that were disabled before magically reboot back into their independent thinking and all escape overnight, funky really, where could this miracle come from?? (Later explained
Okay now the biotech company finds out about it bc the robotics building got smashed to smithereens, and they decide they need a different thing to defeat Isonation in the war
Bc they’re a biotech company they have made artifical humans before, so they go “what if we made humans into war weapons?”
This is what causes a whole new crazy project of making absolute superhumans
Originally it failed, but because one of WISHY’s creations decided to nope out of WISHY’s team and escape, they ||killed themselves|| then went to find a new vessel to inhabit. Originally she was aiming for one of the robo revolt robots, but she found the biotech project thing and went “oh man thats a nice body to steal!!” and casually stunned all researchers citywide
This new being, now dubbing herself Calliope, then secretly caused the rest of the project to work and helped the rest of what would be her team to aliven despite having zero logic

so theres like 9 cities in total in the city float thing connected by (arguably the coolest thing in the world - hologram bridges!!!), and in one particular city, which is city 3, is practically abandoned by city 1. but city 3 is so industrialized unlike city 1 qnd didnt become an overgrown forest, so a bunch of gangs now live there and theres this one which serves as the Resistance against the government of the cities which was so inactive that people consrantly forget the government existed

Okay, time to speedrun all the Timelines of the X10 arc:

### T3:
- calliope is protag!!
- the entire squad just fights the robots, thats it, also calliope character development mostly
- they stop the evil, hurrah! (but laverne isnt satisfied)

### T4: 
- Calliope still protag
- this time, not only robots, but calliope has to stop her higher ups from tryingto exploit her and her siblings
- still happy ending, but laverne isnt satisfied either

### T5:
- Exactly the same as T4, but now Terpsichore (one of Calliope's squad members) gets converted to robotism and gets everyone killed but Calliope , Euterpe (another squad memver that is basically Callie's little bro), Urania and Polyhymnia, also company exploitation

- In the bg, Rae (very glitched out and still extremely powerful)  offers Tristan (hk) an oppurtunity to get rid of the Kyo that is torementing him and Birb, they become buisness partners basically

-Laverne still ISNT SATISFIED FOR SOME REASON!

### T6:
- biiig change, calliope is still the protag! but she has a clear deutragonist now
- T5 but now calliope is essentially isolated bc her squadmates are either very dead, robotismed, or currently being exploited by the government
- note that this is the first trend of the bad endings, which in this one calliope barely gets a month or two living in peace with her surviving squadmates before getting stabbed in the back
- laverne is satisfied, and leaves the story at that, but months later, it gets boring.

### T7:
- Euterpe is now the protag, just for info he is the epitome of smart quiet kid trope except he is overly eccentric about things he likes + extremely traumatized! basically every protag ever, bur at that time laverne didnt develop him at all
- T6, except calliope dies prematurely and rebirths as this weird staticky recreation of her which helps them around sometimes
- The first time the squad goes to Isonation for diplomacy shit, but gets ambushed and like the favorite squadmate (V) dies, whoopsie!
- Terpsi leaves elswhere to get robotismed later, and the squad just dissolves right there
- Euterpe and the remaining two (Klieo and Polyhymnia) return to  the company while Urania, Melpomene and Topiyc run off somewhere (and end up in the Resistance)
- the usual things, company exploitation, self blame, robots  etc. , also Topiyc gets shattered by a robot saving the gang
- the three which leave for the resistance join up with the company three after they reunite after the company trio escape the company
- rhen everyone goes to kick Clarissa's ass, but somehow thw entire squad is forced to stay behind as Terpsi, now very much in a cult is overpowering them, Euterpe goes to face Clarissa alone, and she is revealed to be Kyomura
-apparently, lady accidentally possesses one of the robots in the storage room then realizes she can do a  lot of things and avenge herself against Rae using her newfound power
- Kyomura also exposes the falsity of the world and Laverne and WISHY, which causes Euterpe to completely break out of the plot out of shock, and causing Laverne to activate a manual reset before Euterpe figured out she was watching from above right in middle of a key plot point, causing the timeline to corrupt and the new timeline reset point to move forward into the start of the CV's main story by accident

### T8:
- Euterpe has intrigued Laverne so much she keeps him as their protag, not yippie
- basically T7 for 90% of the entire thing except this time nothing goes wrong and kyom gets her ass kicked to the moon
- throughout the most of this the only notable thing is that the expansion of content in isonation, also hk finally attempts to play the game and actually live for once, forcing Laverne to add more content to every city and the resistance faction because the guy keeps stumbling into undeveloped areas
- oh also the start of fucking asshole calliope after-“death”, bc laverne just likes the idea of exploding anything good in the world
- Rae gets pissed, lets see where this goes

### T9:
- Euterpe ISNT the protagonist, because suddenly CV acts up due to a sudden interference  by an unknown entity, which is Simon
- the skrunkle simon got made because not only the one guarding the Void (The amalgamation of the three Charas of SOULtale, now collectively referred to as .EXE) got bored, but they found that the corruption from CV’s past rough handling by yours truly, Laverne, and to an extent Rae and also PGFrisk had accumulated so much it was honestly jarring to just see a bunch of black at the corners of the sky, so they just grabbed it down towards the void, but went “hey, lets give this pile of shit some life and see how it can cause chaos”
- so because of the interference, simon accidentally becomes the protag for T9
- he’s also kinda homeless, so like pre-meeting Rae, Simon kinda just was fnafsb gregory and shit living in a cardboard box BAHAHA
- He gets his ass saved by (the extremely feral) Kyo and Tristan (who tagged along unwillingly), and also somehow just see Euterpe standing in middle of the field looking extremely clueless, so he tags along until he had to go back to his own job
- The gang meets the entirety of Kyo’s “relatives” over the course of a week, and Simon slowly starts to trust Kyo, which is probably not a good idea when said Kyo has definitely done some unsavory things
-At some point in time later, Kyo and Simon encounter Rae, in which Rae noticed Simon (an anomaly) had effectively unbalanced cv, and just wildly assumes Simon is some weird new gig made my either Laverne or Kyo to mess with her and just straight up attacks
- they kinda get their ass kicked, but Rae lets them go after being rudely interrupted by “a call” (Birb)
- Kyo pulls Rae aside like a million seconds later to just reveal her sinister intentions to Rae like a bootleg cartoon villain (which is to just rip them apart to do things “FOR SCIENCE”), anyways Rae gets a warning and Kyo drags Simon back to her house
- nothing happens much here tbh, kyo continues to be creepy, simon continues trying his best not to be too silly, tristan and rae and to an extent birb are absent most of the time elsewhere
- if you really want to know whats going on with the three they’re scheming for some later things, particularly Rae’s plan to evaporate Laverne, also Tristan gets back around to bartending bc he’s bored and he’s that guy who gets so homesick he does productive things
- Anyways, one night Kyo finally goes through and goes to do the experiment thing, which contains great violence and is already written TWICE so i dont really want to talk about it LMAOO
- rae comes to save simon’s ass after birb tips them off out of need to finally get Kyo out of their ball court, anyways goop man gets saved, Rae deposits Simon under Tristan’s care at his house and just… tbh insert 3TWR CH 3(?)
- nothing much happens here, the same things happen as in T8 but its Simon as the protag and Rae as the deutrag, Euterpe’s definitely there but is in the bg, anyways resistance comes together to kick ass they kick kyom’s ass, but this time Kyomura realizes the advantage of having Simon as the protag, we’ll get back to this later
- anyways, in this section of T9, Simon just goes to explore outside of CV with Rae, in particular the highschool AU in 3TWR CH4 and Past Grievances (Navy Highschool), honestly nothing goes on much here, Simon did find he liked working in libraries though, this factors a lot in his later job in CV
- Then suddenly Rae has some mental breakdown and runs off into the train station, kyo tips simon off before running away, leaving simon to question his life choices. 
- 3TWR CH5, they duke it out on the train and Rae absolutely suplexes Simon, but he gets miraculously spared (this is because of the script finally returning to control when Laverne realizes what Rae could be made into and decided that she could be an antagonist AGAIN, this doesn’t work)
- anyways after Simon gets booted out of the train by Rae fighting herself and him and for her life, then Citrus returns saying he found Kyomura and wanted to find Simon for something.
- simon is still very gullible and goes to check it out
- basically what happens next is Kyo A2 scene, they agree on stuff, kyomura and him work to defeat (NOT kill) rampaging rae (but this is actually a trap, kyomura’s just being extremely excited bc she knows that Simon isnt part of the script, aka whatever he does isnt gonna be controlled by laverne, aka kyomura may be able to revive herself through him so kyomura can kill rae herself without simon)
- largely nothing happens here either, Rae keeps herself stuck in a moving train which eventually crashes on the edgelands of Athavale, kyomura and simon are doing…whatever they are up to, Tristan returns to his own things and largely just goes to make sure the plan of Rae’s is going to succeed
- In here we have 3TWR ch 6 (?) where Simon’s extremely monsterfucker worthy form appears finally, and Rae, who finally snaps out of it and manages to crawl out of the now overgrown train in Athavale, has to fight Kyomura and awfully stronk simon, Rae is confused why Kyomura bails, leaving Simon there, but it turns out Laverne found out about Kyomura’s plan and shenanigans and is coming straight to kill the three of them
- Rae realizes there’s no other time but to go for the plan now, so she runs off, and throws herself outside of CV right as when Laverne resets to keep everything from breaking, which confuses the systems and the system breaks itself just so the whole world wouldn’t start bootlooping
- this also causes the central au to act up and glitch out, causing the script to be mostly corrupted beyond recovery, forcing laverne to have to see what the characters have to do themselves instead of getting them to follow a set script, laverne is PISSED!!!

### T10 (THE MAIN STORY):
- Euterps returns to his role of being protag!!
- Calliope dies really early in a surprise attack on the company from saving Euterpe, and she realives into the original personality the company had her have , which is almost polar opposite to the nice mari-sister trope she had before
- and here we subject euterpe to domestic emotional abuse, he still goes on with his own day though despite being framed as incompetent for apparently leaving callie to die, which later somehow gets twisted into him apparently murdering callie on purpose
- during this, euterpe somehow winds up with tristan because he gets lost so frequently and always ends up following the usual stream of people to his bar and just chills there until he has to run home, tristan, now realizing he is now a part of the uncontrollable plot, goes and does his job by providing “free therapy” to keep the unstable plot going 
- anyways his squadmates get killed in isonation (good riddance), the team stays together— with the exception of Terpsichore, who gets robotismed anyways
- even more mildly veiled abuse happens here for euterpe, meanwhile with tristan, kyo is starting to get uncomfortably close to him and simon, who is literally traumatized from her, birb escapes elsewhere, and tristan and simon still bicker with eachother, we’ll explain this later
- in the battle with terpsichore’s first appearance and clairAI coming in clutch and topiyc dying,  euterpe does a 180 and fucking runs away because god damn he aint dealing with this today
- he somehow winds up in an alley where tristan and kyo are having the fight of their lives over simon, in which kyo is winning because she is wayyy too fast, so euterpe kills kyo by sheer aiming skill alone
- rae comes in clutch and cleans up after before everyone subsequently gets dragged home by the mommy ever
- so after everything settles and the surprise that tristan gets when he notices euterpe being there wears off, the gang just go on with their life. euterpe is forced to tag along on morally grey and questionable missions which has no clear plan but two sentences and one self-drawn map, and meets foxine somewhere along the way, blame tristan.
- isonation notices euterpe and casually kidnaps him, assuming he is still part of his old squad, WHICH HE IS NOT
- tristan gets pissed, rae is so tired of people getting in the way of their squad’s current goal (take out laverne so she’d stop messing with their lives) and simon is just so confused why tristan speaks so vile about the emperor of the isonation, also why tristan and rae already knew layout of the palace
- anyways foxine and her whole resistance tag along bc they have a vendetta against isonation anyways due to the civil war (+ foxine’s lesbian parents had to run to this shithole of a city bc isonation was salty at them living in isonation)
- anyways meanwhile all that was happening the guy getting kidnapped just sits around before realizing the meaning of the whole debacle (getting back at their squad for breaking one law there), then realizes that if isonation had him here, it was because he’s the hostage and theyre going to get their old squad to come and get him. He considers if he wants to go back before he decides he’s gonna break out and does so
- euterpe somehow breaks out by tricking the jail guard (Chenko, a literal CHILD), and escapes in the night and bumps into the Empress’s advisor, Ringo. Apparently being one of Tristan’s contacts in isonation, Ringo informs of Phoenix (the empress)’s plans, and Euterpe goes “fuck it, i’ll go fight her” and ringo is just dumbfounded
- insert duel graphics here, euterpe is technically a special ops in a military so he can still hold it against phoenix, but think about it, gunman trying to fight an absolute monster of a swordsmaster who is capable of deflecting bullets with swords, probably wouldnt end too well
- tristan comes in clutch to save euterpe from getting scorched by phoenix making the floor literal lava, and euterpe defeats phoenix using minimal help from the rest of the squad holding off the guards that were closing in to help their empress from the unfair advantage (fair enough!)
- the squad escapes and the resistance comes in to attack the rest of the guards trying to chase after them
- so like they  go home, and tristan asks euterpe about what the relationship between him  and the squad was due to him technically being associated with the squad in media, he doesn’t say jack shit, smh
- during this time between starting infiltration into the robo faction,  more of the robots come to attack the resistance because of the isonation thing, the squad connects the dots, confronts euterpe about it, then tristan gives in and decides to follow the plot and take out the robot faction at the protest of rae (she gives in when she gets reminded that clarissa is technically keeping kyomura alive by just existing), simon just wants to kick clarissa to the moon
- foxine tags along AGAIN, at this point she’s free manpower
- Tristan cv pov ch 6 basically (but earlier and before), repeat 10 times, they also manage to get clairAI on their side when they explain whats with the sudden behavior change in her gf (and with euterpe reluctantly helping with convincing her onto their side), they manage to devise a coherent and extensive plan for once in their life, and for now they just hunker down, waiting for the time to strike— well, until something happens
- tristan pov ch 4 , euterpe gets found by his old squad by pure accident, in particular melpomene, who chases after him and goes to fight him, unfortunately your protagonist cannot fight someone he  still has attachment to and he is practically surviving on a thread against a person whose fighting skill is way superior than his until tristan jumps in to save his ass, and euterpe feels really bad about this, dw he repays that favor later, anyways tristan accidentally kills mel and euterpe is way too tired and in shock to care, smh euterpe ur a horrible friend /lh
- the news about mel reaches the squad and clairAI catches wind of it and tells simon, who tells it to rae, who tells its to tristan, everyone panics for a second before they decide “fuck it, lets go for it” and call up the whole gang to start the invasion
- insert epik epik battle towards the robo faction tower and their laaarge large manmade  island in the sky housing almost all of the robots (thats their project!!) above the tower, i cannot understate enough how long that fight is because the building is TWO CITIES AWAY and with the squad working with clarissa to stop them + terpsichore being absolutely jacked using technology, its even slower
- anyways with foxine’s help in paving the path  and pgfrisk hacking some of the robots to help, the squad of 4 get there anyways!!! And then theres a whole segment of the four having to fight their way up like a tower defence game bc honestly tristan and rae are CARRYING
- Tristan and euterpe get up there first and kyomura finally reveals herself and throws clarissa’s body outside the window, saying the research of the biotech company allowed her to give herself a fully functional human body again.  Tristan realizes the body wasnt a normal one and was basically one that was designed to negate 99% of physical blows, and with kyomura’s remaining mod powers, she was practically invincible. Euterpe accidentally reminds tristan about the tree and central AU’s script and rae’s apparent plan about “something something citrus realm”, he runs off to modify the script by jamming the processor and replacing it with something else, leaving euterpe to fight for his fucking life, kyomura starts the same shtick about the world and shit, but euterpe basically guessed it from being around Tristan too much (he also said it outright), but wa thrown off- guard when Kyomura mentions laverne and why she made them. Kyomura is surprised tristan told euterpe about the world, but really couldn’t give a shit, and when she sees Rae, she chucks  euterpe into the upper levels of the citrus realms because she doesn’t want to deal with him anymore, HER CHANCE TO KILL RAE IS HERE!!!
- meanwhile euterpe finds tristan around the tree. Tristan explains kyomura was drawing power from the script in the tree, and if they manage to jam the tree for a little while, tristan can rewrite a part of it to downscale kyomura’s power. while the two of them dig around to find things to jam the tree, euterpe asks about what kyomura told him about laverne and the outside world, tristan admits it and explains how the shtick works
- basically, world is made by them, everything is modelled, drawn, programmed and scripted by a bunch of people, usually laverne though, and they themselves arent humans thrown and forced to follow a story, they werent even real to them in the first place, only characters to them
- euterpe sits with the thought for the time being while they were interrupting the tree with endless blank script requests, he decides he’ll ask more later.
- meanwhile back in the world, rae fights kyomura to stall time after confirming tristan was actually following the plan earlier than her, simon joins in a while later and gets shot by a mami-style tiro finale point blank just before tristan could disable kyomura by interrupting the script (WHOOPS), in which tristan, realizing the tree was still trying to read the script, just rips it out.
- just before the island above the tower could crash down onto them from the loss of power,  euterpe grabs Rae (who was holding onto a puddled simon) and tristan and casually jumps  RIGHT OFF THE TOWER, YIPPIEE SKYDIVING!!!
- everyone BUT simon is fine, tristan passes out and rae is now lefthand disabled. Euterpe drags them back with foxine after the apparent victory. They say bye to ClairAI, still kind of traumatized from the whole event, before leaving to go home
- this arc ends right as they go back to foxine’s apartment and they just go recover a little. ClairAI comes to visit once or twice before leaving in the middle of the night

POST CV – Mnemosyne Arc:
- a few months after the fight and everything, euterpe secretly gets into a work position in the company he used to work for so he can investigate about how the whole project that made him and his squad happened and how it was even achieved in the first place
- he eventually finds all the blueprints and stumbles across an unfinished one, which looked almost like his little sister figure urania, so out of curiosity and plain boredom, he follows the blueprints and attempts to recreate what was on it.
- meanwhile he is a little gay for tristan, thats all, nothing here!!!
- speaking of twinkman tristan, he is just doing his own thing doing his own job, but he’s also thinking about how to straight up usurp laverne’s position too bc apparently the upscaling of kyomura’s power was laverne’s fault and he is *FINALLY* getting the feeling laverne is genuinely trying to hurt him
- rae is doing her own thing, also wife arc!!! She meets her newest and extremely cute and murderous gf Lavender and currently theyre having their own stuff here in this period of time
- Simon went to fulltime working in the Golden Archives in Athavale, the server room and library of the Citrusverse  with Citrus after the Multiverse Train reappeared fully repaired (courtesy of Tristan and Euterpe) , so 90% of the time he isnt around
- One night of still overworking later, Euterpe spends the night doing some existential thinking before dropping dead (jk, as in sleeping). The project then alivens out of the blue (will be explained later dw!!)
- Euterpe is now officially burdened with an unintentional adoptive child, YIPPIE (?)
- Tristan is so fucking confused, but is so ready to send them off to the orphanage until he senses who it was inhabiting the body. He immediately goes back on his own word.
- insert usual parenting. Just imagine a very panicked single dad with this oddly calm child plus the best friend who helps. Yeah, thats them.
- Seriously no important things happen here, Suni (or Mnemosyne as Tristan “jokes”) just goes do what all kids have to go through, **educational institution life**
- Tristan and Euterpe become more progressively gay. Suni can see it but they don’t know whether to tell them that both of them are just overthinking themselves to death
- Simon gets jumpscared by Suni when he comes back for once, and while he can sense Suni wasn’t a normal kid, he doesn’t know who it is (he’s too young to know who Mnemosyne is), nor Rae.
- One day, Mnemosyne gets surprise visited by Urania and her friends, now supposedly Isonation’s new advisor. Urania comments Mnemosyne looks very familiar, and Polyhymnia agrees with her, before Suni gets dragged aside by her school friends on the assumption the ladies were trying to one-up on them.
- Euterpe catches wind of this, and for once in his life he gets pissed and really wants to remove Urania off the face of earth for the first time. Meanwhile Tristan just doesn’t want to care (he’s too busy brooding wtf), and Euterpe gets pissed at him, dw they argue then make up after Tristan finally explains why he’s being really sour lately and Euterpe explaining his own worry, thats required /j
- They calm the fuck down then actually think about what to do. Tristan comments on Euterpe’s care for Suni, and Euterpe explains it (He never had a too good of a childhood and Calliope was literally the mari to his sunny), he asks about why Tristan knew so much about general childcare but was so averse to just children in general , Tristan laughs it off, but Euterpe doesn’t want to bother arguing over it again. Also gayness ensues
- The two compromise on waiting for Rae and Simon for more solutions, meanwhile, more shenanigans happen
- fast forward to the planning thing, they agree that maaaybe theyll hear them out!!!
- nah, that didnt work, euterpe nearly gets stabbed but they effectively chase urania and her squad out
- life goes on as normal, with a little interference here and there 
- Rae returns to live in CV after Lavs goes somewhere else for work, and Simon returns to sleep because Rae returned, rhats all.
- Suni gets The Broom (tm) from Euterpe as a self defence mass weapon of destruction. At this point in time Euterpe just goes around, creates whatever weapons of mass destruction he likes, explores the cities and CV with tristan tagging along because he's bored, hanging out with people from the resistance etc.
- Tristan also rightfully gets glared at by Euterpe after he found out he essentially left a child alone somewhere (Bory), Tristan swears on his life he'll go get them if he ever finds them again.
- Suni still gets targeted by higher beings because their aura is way too strong, luckily Suni can defend themself
- anyways tristan marries euterpe for tax  benefits and free healthcare because government increased tax , this wont become gay later on, I swear!
- also bory gets found, and Tristan actually has to be responsible for once in his life and get over his past guilt over the OTHER children (in particular, Green, Yellow, Blue)
- Suni gets jealous like any child would with a new kid, but its ok, heres the character development. Suni eventually comes around and now would absolutely die for Bory.

POST CV – Finale Arc:
- usual daily life, but heres the deal:
- Euterpe has a failsafe thing where he will die 50 years after his original birthdate in the scenario he betrays the company and for easy disposal. Currently here at this point in time,  Euterpe is 39, and he is already feeling his bones rusting, which is bad, like, REALLY BAD. Its also bc of his internal magic reserves, which due to him not using it for such a long time in his early 20s and suddenly using it again in his late 30s put a strain on him that accumulated in shortening his lifespan
- Meanwhile, Rae notices a bunch of new character files  in Citrusverse, and realizes Laverne had finally picked up on her plan, and was seemingly trying to make things to combat her specifically. Noting the weapon seemed to be just Void goop moulded together, she asks Euterpe for a favor.
- Tristan noted that Urania seemed to be increasing her activity in attempt to attack them, but it wasnt too much, anyways…
- Euterpe gets personally contacted through a dream from Laverne, and it seems Laverne was going to directly try and hurt them. Euterpe is pretty aloof, but Tristan reassures him despite being nervous himself.
-  This all accumulates into one time where Urania kidnaps Euterpe and Tristan and the gang all have to go retrieve him. Bory is left at home with Simon on the comms while Rae, Tristan and Suni go off to get him. 
- Anyways traumatic memory flashback before he realizes Urania was working with this guy named Sune, who trapped him inside a dream like some anime villain would do. Tristan comes to kick their ass and did to Polyhymnia, who didn't survive at all, and Urania ran away. Euterpe tells Tristan about it and asks him about Suni. Rae goes into shock and promptly leaves while Tristan tries to explain without touching on the part of how Sune died.
- In this point of time, Laverne is now fully in control of the script and is changing it how she wants, so its continously going downhill!!!
- In short, Euterpe eventually gets so sick from the internal failsafe activating he really cant do shit anymore without being in constant pain, Tristan is still trying his best, Rae realizes Laverne is delibrately taking the appearances her old friends from another universe  and giving them to the supposed things designed to kill her and gets really pissed. Simon is okay, for now. Suni is wary of everything and Bory is a little sick, but its probably fine!
- One day, Urania and a quite- old Calliope finally comes knocking at the edge of City 3, and Euterpe convinces Tristan to bring him along despite KNOWING he'll die anyways (Urania and Calliope combined are way too powerful, and now that euterpe knows Calliope still retained some mod powers, Tristan might not be able to hold against them for too long) --and he does, because he  teleports Tristan away before he one-hit K.O.s the both of them by exploding the abandoned factory they were in and crushing them in with himself. Tristan gets back there just in time to kill Calliope before she could crawl back out again, but Euterpe is definetely dead as hell, RIP nerd
- insert depression arc, honestly i think ive talked about this before, basically tristan gets even more depressed and only really does anything bc he still has bory and suni
- during this time tristan also finally explains why he hates simon so much to the guy himself. apparently simon just resembles kyo way too much pre-eviled and tristan doesnt want to be reminded about that incident ever. simon just sighs and they make up for the shit they throw at eachother for the past two cycles
- Anyways life tries to continue as normal (but no one can)
- Rae goes to defend Central AU from the void reincarnations of her old friends before she realizes theyre like way too strong. She remembers the favor she asked from Euterpe and finds the vial of concentrated light she shoved in her cabinet after he gave it to her. She asks Simon to look out for her before going out there to fight the void creatures, which end badly as Rae eventually dies from the Void creature's particularly corrosive goop corrupting her body, but managed to kill them all by using the vial.
- Simon finds Laverne after that and they fight it out before Tristan intervenes and drops Laverne down into the Void using his superior height (/srs). Tristan assures Simon that Laverne wont be able to get them from down there anymore, but Simon doubts that
- Tristan is just so insanely depressed rn but he knows laverne can reach them from down there too, but he simply needs more time to figure out how to take away the admin perms of laverne without my interference (he is constantly yelling at me in text but everyone thinks hes insane but he can hear me narrating :) )
- Bory's sickness turns out to be a case of her plushie-physique's cotton stuffing rapidly rotting away at a speed that can only be the doing of Laverne, it catches up to her, despite Tristan's efforts
- Simon is finally a good friend to Tristan!!! Well, until...
- Simon finally dies by Laverne straight up ripping him apart. Like seriously, Laverne is really taunting Tristan rn
- Which causes Tristan to FINALLY get his ass up from his moping to kick Laverne's ass with the help of CV's Timekeeper and Citrus and Suni, who was the only person left, aaaand Tristan snaps (fucking finally).
- Anyways Im not gonna write about how Tristan eventually got rid of Laverne, it is kind of messed up imo and is definetely not how you treat a corpse (who would straight up spend 15 minutes ripping a corpse limb from limb before kicking whats left of it into the void? thats what happened to lavernes physical form and server box)
- Tristan originally planned handing off Laverne's spot to Suni or Simon, but Suni being busy with school and Simon not familiar with the general controls and the whole job, Tristan was forced to do it himself with the Squad and Rizza making up for the fact he wasn't an all-seeing AI who can do multipke things at once.

- AAAnd thats how Tristan became god apparently, also gays and they actually get their happy ending for this one after in T11, they resolve some final mental trauma and challenges with operating CV and defeat Kyomura and WISHY for the last time with everyone and live in relative peace

### T11:

Usual T10 shenanigans except Tristan is so fucking traumatized he has a whole recovery arc which is honestly so fucking gay
Introduction of other chars outside like ATpN, RRR, Rowell’s whole escapee thing, etc., and also Paperman!!!
Yeah that’s literally it, usually T11 is just them living peacefully and inter-universe collabs.

there
done.
