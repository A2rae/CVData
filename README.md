# CVData --- The README file
Basically i host my own stuff on this repo because i have no where else that i can do that

Look into individual files for character info.

>Note:

>All the character bios are based in T11 mainly, but have T10 traits mixed in midst of them. Reference with discretion

For the actual written fics and reference images, check [here](https://a2chives.carrd.co).
